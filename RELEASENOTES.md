# RELEASE NOTES

## Migration Information

**This version removes support for direct migration from versions before v8.1.0 (Doris)**

See [migration path](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Upgrading#migration-path) for instructions how to migrate to a major version. Pay attention to the following version breaks due to dynamic settings updates:

1. Migrate to **Sonoff-Tasmota 3.9.x**
2. Migrate to **Sonoff-Tasmota 4.x**
3. Migrate to **Sonoff-Tasmota 5.14**
4. Migrate to **Sonoff-Tasmota 6.7.1** (http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/release-6.7.1/)
5. Migrate to **Tasmota 7.2.0** (http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/release-7.2.0/)

--- Major change in parameter storage layout ---

6. Migrate to **Tasmota 8.5.1** (http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/release-8.5.1/)

--- Major change in internal GPIO function representation ---

7. Migrate to **Tasmota 9.1** (http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/release-9.1.0/)

While fallback or downgrading is common practice it was never supported due to Settings additions or changes in newer releases. Starting with release **v9.1.0 Imogen** the internal GPIO function representation has changed in such a way that fallback is only possible to the latest GPIO configuration before installing **v9.1.0**.

## Supported Core versions

This release will be supported from ESP8266/Arduino library Core version **2.7.4.9** due to reported security and stability issues on previous Core version. This will also support gzipped binaries.

Support of Core versions before 2.7.1 has been removed.

## Support of TLS

In addition to TLS using fingerprints now also user supplied CA certs and AWS IoT is supported. Read [full documentation](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/AWS-IoT)

## Initial configuration tools

For initial configuration this release supports Webserver based **WifiManager** or **Serial** based command interface only. Support for **WPS** and **SmartConfig** has been removed.

## Provided Binary Downloads

### ESP8266 or ESP8285 based
The following binary downloads have been compiled with ESP8266/Arduino library core version **2.7.4.9**.

- **tasmota.bin** = The Tasmota version with most drivers. **RECOMMENDED RELEASE BINARY**
- **tasmota-BG.bin** to **tasmota-TW.bin** = The Tasmota version in different languages.
- **tasmota-lite.bin** = The Lite version without most drivers and sensors.
- **tasmota-knx.bin** = The Knx version without some features but adds KNX support.
- **tasmota-sensors.bin** = The Sensors version adds more useful sensors.
- **tasmota-ir.bin** = The InfraRed Receiver and transmitter version allowing all available protocols provided by library IRremoteESP8266 but without most other features.
- **tasmota-display.bin** = The Display version without Energy Monitoring but adds display support.
- **tasmota-zbbridge.bin** = The dedicated Sonoff Zigbee Bridge version.
- **tasmota-minimal.bin** = The Minimal version allows intermediate OTA uploads to support larger versions and does NOT change any persistent parameter. This version **should NOT be used for initial installation**.

Above binaries are also available as gzipped version allowing faster uploads.

The attached binaries can also be downloaded from http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/release. The links can be used for OTA upgrades too like ``OtaUrl http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/release/tasmota.bin.gz``

### ESP32 based
The following binary downloads have been compiled with ESP32/Arduino library core version **1.0.6**.

- **tasmota32.bin** = The Tasmota version with most drivers including additional sensors and KNX.  **RECOMMENDED RELEASE BINARY**
- **tasmota32solo1.bin** = The Tasmota version with most drivers including additional sensors and KNX for single core ESP32.
- **tasmota32-BG.bin** to **tasmota32-TW.bin** = The Tasmota version in different languages.
- **tasmota32-ir.bin** = The InfraRed Receiver and transmitter version allowing all available protocols provided by library IRremoteESP8266 but without most other features.
- **tasmota32-display.bin** = The Display version without Energy Monitoring but adds display support.
- **tasmota32-webcam.bin** = The Webcam version adds webcam support.
- **tasmota32-bluetooth.bin** = The Bluetooth version adds BLE support.
- **tasmota32-odroidgo.bin** = The Odroid-Go version is specifically tailored to Odroid_go hardware.
- **tasmota32-core2.bin** = The Core2 version is specifically tailored to M5Stack Core2 hardware.

The attached binaries can also be downloaded from http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota32/release. The links can be used for OTA upgrades too like ``OtaUrl http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota32/release/tasmota32.bin``

## Changelog v9.4.0.1
### Added
- Command ``Wifi 0/1`` for ESP8266 to turn wifi Off and On. When wifi is Off it is always returned On after a restart except for a wake-up from deepsleep [#11839](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/issues/11839)

### Breaking Changed

### Changed
- Command ``Power`` should not reset pulsetime [#11805](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/issues/11805)
- Zigbee refactored storage for device configuration and device last known data [#11838](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/issues/11838)

### Fixed

### Noted
- ESP32 single core **tasmota32solo1.bin** binary can only be uploaded using the GUI as OTA upload will trigger the watchdog timer
